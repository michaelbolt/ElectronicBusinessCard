- Finally got back around to tinkering! I just got CCS, git, Sublime, and all that stuff set up on here
- Looking back over my last entry, what did I promise to do?
-- "finish" the game, lol
-- make the player ship explode, easy enough
-- count the number of lives, again easy enough
-- enter high scores. Oof. That's a lot of work cuz it requires entering initials which requires all those ASCII sprites... Maybe we'll just save the one maximum score and show it at the end with a "NEW HIGH SCORE" message. Or I could put the high core in the middle of the HUD? that's probaby the easiest way to do it. Then if the score is greater than max, trigger a fun litle fireworks show for the player.

 Okay, so here's the breakdown of what I'll need to do:
- a little heart sprite, 5 pixels tall for the player's life count
- game logic to handle the player dying
-- clear the screen of enemies, wait a couple seconds, etc.
- high score saved to FRAM and displayed at the tippy top of the screen.

Time to go to work!
- Got a little heart sprite, put it away.
