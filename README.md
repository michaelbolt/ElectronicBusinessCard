# ElectronicBusinessCard
This repository contains the code I am developing for my Electronic Business Card project. To see writeups and follow my progress, follow my blog: [Mr. Dr. Prof. Bolt](https://mrdrprofbolt.wordpress.com/).

## Current State of the Project:
The MSP430FR2433 microcontroller is able to communicate with the SSD1306 OLED display through I2C and draw simple, pixel-based artwork.
